Situations
==========

This project contains sources of the last official Symbian^3 version
of Situations app (v1.6.16). The sources were restored from a zip file,
references to other platforms, namely N9 / Harmattan, were stripped
away and no effort was made to make sure the project still builds.

The sources are made available purely for educational(?) puroposes and to
entertain any remaining Symbian enthusiasts. No further development or
maintenance is planned.

Largely rewritten version of Situations application is nowdays
available for Sailfish OS and Android (sources not available).

Build for testing
-----------------

Sorry, you need to figure this out yourself. Go get yourself a
Symbian^3 environment from somewhere and build on top. We haven't built
this old branch of the project for ages.
